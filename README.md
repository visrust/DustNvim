## Problem it solves ?

Around mid of 2025 when I arrived in Neovim from Emacs I found nvim is needed to be configured from scratch. I had joined nvim to get smarter and better features and I started to configure neovim; it felt very hard and I shifted to Distro's like LunarVim but they were incompatible for my termux and this made me make my own distribution which welcomes everyone 

The type of problem it solves is complex as it depends on your kind of problem as DustNvim is full of :

1. Themes that any programmer deserves.

2. Ui layer that shows opened buffers , tell lsp diagnostics.

3. Minimal but better keybindings that include Fzf Yazi 

4. Majors languages like C , Rust , Go being Already setup

5. Every feature you can think of including undo_history , buffer picker , file navigation and motions , faster inbuilt terminal 

6. Resonable amount of plugins with Lazy plugin manager.

7. Faster startup around ~1/2.5 seconds (~400ms) even on Snapdragon-4gen-1. 

8. Easy to vibe-code with ai and debug with dap.

9. Less mistake chances due to on screen pop-up diagnostics on CursorHold.
